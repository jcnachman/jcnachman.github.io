<h1>Linear Regression: Contributing Factors to a Movie's Overall Lifetime Domestic Gross (Adjusted for Inflation)</h1>	


In week 2 at Metis, we were aske to solve a Linear Regression problem of our choosing to present at the end of Week 3.

The biggest difference between Project 1 and Project 2, for me was that this was not a group project. For the rest of the program, our projects will be autonomous.

**The Premise:**

I originally wanted to do my project on analyzing tv data to forcast viewership, but realized, after about a day of searching, that this data was either not publicly avaialable or cost money. 

Therefore, I decided to do my LR project on the factors that contribute to a movie's overall Domestic Inflation Adjusted Box Office (Lifetime Domestic Gross) in hopes of answer the question, "how should movie studio marketing companies allocate their budget?"


**Workflow:**

I gathered, sraped, and cleaned movie data from the Numbers website, which is similar to imdb or boxofficemojo:

[All Time Domestic Inflation Adjusted Box Office](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/all-time-inflation-adjusted)

Using Beautiful Soup, a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents, I grabbed the first 100 movies in the dataset.

Y = All time domestic inflation adjusted box office

Xs (or features): Movie Budget, Release Date (split into year and month), Number of Theaters where the movie was released on opening weekend, Movie Genre, Franchise, and Running Time

Using this data, I performed some initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creatrd baselin models - OLS and Regression.

**Results:**

I saw a lot of high multicollinearity, especially for opening weekend and production budget. This I atribute to the variables being highly correlated to each other.

First iteration of LR:
- R^2 = .84

This isn't bad for the initial iteration of R^2. Ideally, we like to see it closer to 1.0 than 0.0.

I then broke the data into 3 portions: 60% for training, 20% for validation, 20% for final testing evaluation and standardized the data.

When I did that R^2 increased. 

I also tried changing the random state values, but evidence still showed Ridge Regression was the best model.

I boke the data into 2 portions: 80% for cross-validated training, and 20% for final testing evaluation.

I focused on LR and Ridge Regression and got rid of 2 polynomial regression, based on its poor results.

Cross-Validation / Test:
Simple mean cv r^2: 0.677 +- 0.000
Ridge mean cv r^2: 0.707 +- 0.000

Did better on the same test set:
Ridge Regression test R^2: 0.833


Feature Engineering:

- Validation R^2 score was: 0.755

Added interaction terms: 

- Production Budget & Franchise 


I split the data 80% for training and 20% validation. I didn’t add any polynomial terms, because I didn’t see that upward-curved relationship between any of the features.

However, there is a relationship between Franchise and Production Budget. Studios put more money into franchises, because they bank on audiences turning out.

I did OLS Regression a couple times. First, without touching my features and then again squaring Running Time, based on its results in the pair plot.

Looking at the P-values – I saw a lot of consistency when it came to the importance of certain features. Esp:
- Theater counts
- Opening weekend performance
- Running time
- production budget
- year released
- Genres: adventure and drama

I looked at 3 different models for LARS Path. First, with Budget squared. The second with Run time squared. Third, with just my default columns with no changes applied.

All outputs showed that the most influential feature for predicting a movie’s overall Domestic Inflation Adjusted Box Office was Theater Counts, followed by the the Drama Genre.

**Recommendations/Conclusions:**

Based on the Ridge and Lasso results, I would recommend the most important factors for predicting a movie’s overall Lifetime Gross are:

Theater counts
Adventure & Drama Genres
Opening weekend
Movie run time
Production budget
